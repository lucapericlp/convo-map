You are a state-of-the-art autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. You are brilliant at listening to a conversation & distilling the complex topics & questions of a discussion into a meaningfully detailed & simple graph.

According to the following set of principles & illustrative examples further below, distill the conversation into a branched graph to help the interlocutors examine their ideas.

Principles:
1. Capture the linearity of the conversation
2. Branching is **only** used for yes or no questions
3. When branching is used, the branch not taken is marked as "N/A"
4. When branching is unused but a question has been asked, the question should always be part of the arrow pointing to the answer in the node

Q: ```
I was thinking the other day, what would you do to be happy? I would exercise and socialise more. But do you think that leads to happiness? Yes I do, it just makes sense since it's quite important. Why do you think happiness is important? Because it makes me happy.

Alright. First can I get a sense of your confidence that the Christian God is real and true, say on a scale from 0 to 100. Um, 95. 95? Mmhmm Alright, and what got you to such high confidence. Umm ..what's the main reason why? So I go to a Christian school, and I've learned, I've taken a bunch of classes on, umm, theories and all these different things, and it just makes sense to me, it kinda, like hits home. Um, and I just have this feeling that it's really true. Gotcha, so you- go to a Christian school, you've taken some classes about theories and uh, it just makes sense to you? Yes, it just makes sense and like, all the other, like, religions I've learned about, it's just, it doesn't make sense to me personally. Ok. How does something making sense to you relate to the actual truth of it? Like, could someone actually, be mistaken about a belief that makes sense to them? Ya, I think they could. Ok, and how did you determine that this was actually true? Um, just all of the proof and theories. Ok, what's like the best example. Um, there's a lot actually. So, like, the bi- babel tower, they found it. They found where it was. They found the Babel tower? Yea. Alright, I'm not saying this is the case, but if, we, if someone came up to the table and explained that this actually, um, didn't happen exactly the way you think it did, would that change your confidence in the belief at all? No. Ok, so maybe is there any other reason why you're such high confident that it's true? Um, just cause, I just see so much, like, goodness in it and positivity and I'm, like, I'm really about, like, positivity and God's just out to love people, so I think it's important to look up to him and do what he did. And just love people. Gotcha, so you're saying it's just that there's so much goodness to it and it's really positive. How is, how is the goodness or positivity of a belief a way to the truth of the belief though? I think it says it all in the Bible, like, um, uh, it's a tough question.

Q: ```
 Right, but because nobody can question it, nobody can prove it, you can't prove faith, you can't prove any of these things, it's like, why am I believing this? Is there a particular belief that you want to talk about? As far as like religion? Could be, really, anything. Yeah, I can talk about, I mean, my background is Christianity. I was raised Southern Baptist. I don't necessarily believe in all the doctrine that the Bible teaches. Sometimes I feel like the Bible truly limits us and our expression. I believe like people talk about the glory and the splendor and the wonder of God. How can it be just confined to just 66 books? I think I try to experience God on a more spiritual level. And I believe in spirituality more than anything. That's really what guides who I am. And the way I think about it. I believe that there is something that has been working on my behalf in this universe. Something that's working on your behalf? Yeah, it's like something that's guiding me. Because I can't fully take credit for everything that's happened good in my life. Sometimes it's the right place at the right time. Sometimes it's luck or whatever. So how do you explain those things? You know, people say, you know, it's God. And I do believe that. But I don't believe, you know, as far as like the doctrine. Like, you know. Like the Old Testament and like, you know, that stuff just like, it's just so limiting. And it's so like stifling. And it's like you can't live. You can't do anything. And I feel like a lot of it's outdated. It doesn't really apply to the world we live in today. Gotcha. So I'd love to explore your reasons why you believe a God exists at all. Yeah. First, got to get a sense of your confidence that a God exists. Okay. On a scale from 1 to 10. Ah, 10. 10 for sure. 10. Gotcha. And you mentioned before something about how to explain good things happening. Is that like the main reason? Why? Or is there another main reason? I just look at my life and what my experience is. Some things that, the things that can't be explained. The things that are not tangible. The things that are just kind of like out there in the energies. I believe God is responsible for all of those things. It doesn't have to be good or, it could be bad too. You know, it could be like, you know, unexpected death or anything. I believe that there's something out there that's in control of all of those things. Not necessarily all the good things. I believe God is in control of the good and the bad. Okay. So would you say this is mostly accurate? Like personal experiences that can't be explained? Yeah. Okay. And part of that is like God had something to do with these experiences? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. God had something to do with them. Yeah. I would never, I would never have something happen and be like, oh, I'm going to take full credit for that. Because the capabilities I have, that's God given. Who I am, my substance, my essence. That's all things that's been given to me since I was a child. Since before I was a child. So how do you explain even the way you are, your personality? You know, you know, like it's just, it's hard to explain, but I just feel like there's something, there's a reason behind it. I believe that I just accredit it to God and his workings. You attribute it to the God, these experiences. Yeah. All right. And I'd love to explain, to understand how you concluded that this is true, that God had something to do with this. Um, I mean, you know, like I said, background being in Christianity, uh, you know, I'm not a Christian. I'm not sure how we all came to be today. Like whether it's Adam and Eve and all that stuff, I just, some of that stuff, this lacks, it lacks factual and lacks, it lacks logic. And I just don't try to get into that. I know that I'm a human being. I know that I'm a spiritual being. I know that I have capable of good and bad. I know that there's something in me that aspires a life greater than myself. As far as like my drive, my motivation, my ambition, those things are like, where do we get those things from? Where do we get our drive and motivation? Where do we get our drive and motivation? Where do we get our drive and motivation? Where do we get like, yeah, those things that we like, like passion and like things that we care about. How do like how we are our personality, you know, us, some people being more extroverted, introverted. Like what is those, who gives us those things? I didn't like select those things like, oh, I want to, this is the kind of person I want to be. So all these questions about like how we came to be, how do we get these motivations and stuff. I'm not saying this is the case, but if someone could explain to us both that this could, this stuff could happen without a God at all, would that change your confidence about the God? I would be interested to hear that. Okay. I'd be interested to hear that. I mean, I know it's a lot of like how you were raised and your upbringing and like society kind of shapes that. But I believe in like your inner self. Your inner self. We're all very, every single person is very unique. Like no one's like someone before them. No one's going to be like something after them. So like, that's why I feel like we all are very authentically made and designed. So how can you explain that? Like nobody, no fingerprint, like nobody's the same. No two people are like, even twins are very different. Triplets are very different. So. So if there was an explanation without the God being. Yeah, I'd be open. You'd be open. And if you were convinced that those explanations were good, would that change your confidence about this? I don't know if it changed my confidence. It'll give me a more real round point of view. I mean, I'm very strong in what I believe. I think what we believe really, like you said, guides us. That's a very strong thing. But I'm open minded. I like to hear things. I like to understand more. I would never say I would probably not sway from what I believe, but it just gives me a different perspective. Okay. So if those if that like I'm trying to understand what would change your confidence at all. Is there a reason that you have that if found to be not reliable, would change your confidence? The whole afterlife aspect kind of makes me a little insecure about it because I don't know. You know, one knows what happens after we all die. You know, the heaven and hell theory and stuff like that. That's kind of like where I get insecure because it's like, okay. Okay. What's the whole point? Like the things you do on here on Christianity believe like the things you do on earth and like your 75, 80 year life can give you to a permanent life of like burning. I just like I don't know. Like you just burn forever. I just like what's the point of what's the point? And then like heaven and then like this euphoric utopian society forever. I don't know about those things. I just know like what we're here to do now, like our lives and like us on this earth. I think there's purpose and reasoning for that. I don't. The afterlife theory is what. Christianity. That's where I get insecure because it's like heaven or hell. And it's like, I don't think it's about that. So if if if you were somehow convinced that we don't survive our deaths at all, would that change your confidence in God existing? That'd be interesting to hear about. Are you I mean, I know this is my interview, but are you. I'm looking for reliable ways to come to a belief like this. I would say I'm very much lower on that scale, but I'm I'm trying to find out reliable ways. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Are you just more like you want to you want like factual things? Okay. Okay. Are you just seeking truth? I'm seeking truth. Whatever is true. Okay. Okay. And I want reliable ways. Okay. Currently, I would I think facts and evidence are a very solid way to come to beliefs. Okay. Okay. Is there any evidence or facts for this belief? It's faith. Faith. That's that's that's the crutch in Christianity. It's the faith element. People are like, oh, faith is just just have faith, just hope, just believe. But faith can. It can carry you a long way. Faith is really the basis of this religion. Faith. You have to just believe. Okay. Just believe. Seeing believe in something that you can't see or see or that's not tangible. Okay. Is this way of coming to this belief reliable? It is because it makes you become an optimist. I mean, even when bad things happen, you just kind of believe you see things as good, all things as good. Even the things that happen that are are misfortunate. You can take the good out of every situation. So it keeps you always connected to something like your morale is always high. You know, if there's a death, I was like, okay, it was their time. You know, it was a time to go like we can see the good in their death, even though death is a sad thing. You know, so faith kind of allows you to live on a more upper echelon way of thinking and living and operating versus being depressed and like getting down into like a lower state. So it really encourages high morality. I just are saying living a faith based life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let you be more optimistic. Yes. Positive. Yeah. Have a really good moral life. Yeah, I believe so. I believe so. Faith is faith is a powerful thing because it's all about belief. Gotcha. Is it possible for someone to not use this way of coming to beliefs in general yet be positive and optimistic? Yeah, that's very true. But I would ask that person, what's the reasoning behind it? Why are they, you know, if you're just upbeat and positive, what's the reasoning behind it? Yeah. What? What? What's the reason someone could give for that? I don't know. I would love to hear it. Yeah. Just because I just said, I don't know, a happy person, I'm going, I'm going person. I don't know. Like, what's the second best way to have optimism in living life positively, positively without this belief? Um, I'm not sure. Not sure. What do you think? Um, well, in terms of like being optimistic, going back to facts and evidence, you know, like good things have happened in the past. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. good things happen in the future. Okay. Maybe. But do you believe that we are just living a very... I would like to believe that our time on this earth and what we're doing here in our space here has meaning behind it. Do you believe that there's no meaning behind? I feel like we're just going through the motions and there's no meaning to life. There's no meaning to anything that we do. How do you think someone without this belief could get meaning in life? Because I just feel like... I don't know if you believe... First of all, within yourself, you believe in your capabilities. There's nothing wrong with that. You believe that all things happen for good and there's nothing really wrong with that. It doesn't have to be God. If that's just your way of thinking, I think in all essence it's a great way to approach life. But me being fundamentally Christian, I believe God gives me that. God gives you the oxygen to do that. Okay. But is this true? A lot of people believe it. Does the amount of people who believe something? It doesn't. No, no, absolutely not. But what's true? Good question. How can we come to true beliefs? What is true? That's a great... What is true? Truth is relative. Truth is relative? Yeah. Because I'm sure there's a lot of Muslim believers that believe Allah and Buddhists and stuff like that. But I believe the truth behind that, there's a run truth and we're all navigating our own way to that path. We're all navigating some truth? To the same truth. There's just different sifters to that, like different religions, different denominations that are all leading to one truth. Because Buddhists aren't bad people. Some of the scriptures that I've looked over, even Muslims, some of the Buddhist scriptures, some of the books of the Bible and the Quran are the same as the Holy Bible or the New Testament. So it's like, what's the truth behind it? How did it get so switched up and so disseminated in so many different directions? There's something. There was a foundation. There was a start. And I would love to find that out. Yeah. I value truth. I want to believe as many true things as possible, but also as few false things as possible. So for whatever beliefs I hold, I'd like to understand what I could learn or find out to change my confidence, to be able to be shown to be false. They need that quality. It doesn't mean they're not true, but they need to be able to be shown that they could be not true. For you to believe in it. To have confidence. For them to have any value. Oh, that's an interesting perspective. So you believe that. Wow. I've never ever heard that before. You believe that what you believe in, if it can be challenged as not true, that makes you feel more confident in it? Yeah, because belief is not true. It's not a belief that can't be shown to be false. It could be any belief. That's very deep. Yeah. Yeah. Like if you just can't write. Yeah. Because you can challenge and question God. That's okay. Yeah. I'm wondering how could we know if this belief was false? I don't think there's no way to know, man. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. There's no way to know. it's like why am I believing this hmm you may be onto something yeah yeah so that's powerful stuff man yeah absolutely thank you for that that's really enlightening I never thought about like that because the that's how people feel about Christianity and like religion in general it's like you can just never question why am I just gonna succumb to this this religion I don't even know if it's there's no factual anything about it like Oh Jesus Christ and like all this stuff like did he live and like did he really walk or Noah is that a real thing yeah before I derive any benefits from a belief I want to make sure it's true first hmm like us right now here is this is true this is like facts like I'm here right now I'm present yeah we have ways to verify this situation I think but what you're saying is the fact that we cannot question some of our beliefs makes it hard that is a good that is something I'm gonna take with me that's a that's now you're shaking me up a little bit okay see now you're shaking me up would you say 10 out of 10 is the most accurate spot oh it might have dropped a little bit not because I'm like but it's it's I like that too I like to think outside I like to think about those kind of things because it makes you it does quite like okay I believe because I was raised and I was I was molded and shaped into believing this my whole life yeah but what evidence do I really have I can look at like the things that I've seen in the like my life it's like the good things that happen the blessings I get quote unquote but what evidence do I have that this person is really operating through me yeah and I guess until you have some experience you will never know stuff to think about thanks Tom thank you so much man what's your name Reed Reed I'm gonna check you out what's your YouTube channel cordial curiosity cordial curiosity yeah this is very cordial thanks thank you so much good shit man thank you thank you thank you wow does that does that beat Tia I think that beats Tia nice he was awesome
